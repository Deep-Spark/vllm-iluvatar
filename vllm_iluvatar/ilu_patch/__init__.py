"""Iluvatar patch layer.

Two kinds of patches live here:

  1. Early import-compat shims + import-hook registration
     (``patch_import_compat.py`` / ``patch_custom_ops.py``).  These are applied
     at startup via ``vllm_iluvatar._load_import_compat_patch()`` (main process
     + spawned workers), BEFORE deep ``import vllm`` — they are NOT imported by
     this package ``__init__`` to keep startup cheap.  Required for community
     symbols called at *import time* (e.g. ``vllm._custom_ops``).

  2. Late-phase (general_plugins) patches that only need an initialised vLLM
     (module/class objects present).  Wiring modules live in
     ``ilu_patch.general_patches`` and expose ``register()``; override
     implementations stay in upstream-mirrored packages such as
     ``vllm_iluvatar.distributed``. They are auto-discovered + applied by
     ``apply_general_patches()`` from ``register_general`` (the
     ``vllm.general_plugins`` entry point).

To add a late-phase patch: put the override implementation in the
upstream-mirrored module, then add one small wiring module under
``ilu_patch.general_patches`` exposing ``def register() -> None``. The wiring
module should perform lazy imports, guards, and rebinding only.
