"""Expose the package version, which is defined in the repo-root version.json.

``version.json`` is the single source of truth mandated by the release spec, so
it must not be duplicated here. It ships outside the package though, and is
therefore unavailable once the wheel is installed -- in that case the version
is read back from the installed distribution metadata, which setup.py filled in
from the very same file at build time.
